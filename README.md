# *Test API Project in GoLang*

A GoLang RESTful API Application that accepts records/requests of type /geo and /device/info and prints them out to the console. It accepts GET, POST, PATCH, PUT, DELETE, HEAD, and OPTIONS requests.Â It then marshalls the requests into a GoStruct (geo object, and device info object) and sends them to MongoDB for storage. *TODO: Skills implemented include: GoLang, HTTP requests, MongoDB*
