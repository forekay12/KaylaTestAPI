A GoLang RESTful API Application that accepts records/requests of certain types and prints them out to the console. It accepts any request given and prints them out to the console.Â It then marshalls the requests into a GoStruct (georecord object, and device details) and sends them to a DB. *TODO: Skills implemented include: XXX*
